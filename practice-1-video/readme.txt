It should have a play/pause button.
It should have a mute/unmute button.
It should have a progress bar.
It should have display current time and total time, for example: 0:01:25 / 0:05:33
Clicking on the video area should play/pause the video
At the end of the video the play/pause button will change to a replay button.
It shouldn’t auto play
It should have a poster image
If there’s an error loading the video, display a message like “Something went wrong loading the video”.
If the browser doesn’t support HTML5 video, display a fallback image and a message to indicate the user that the browser doesn’t support the video feature.
